us an upgraded apartment We got moved in all seemed to be ok Well the first rain came and that all changedSee the posted photos The ceiling leaked causing what we called our ceiling zit They fixed the roof but not the ceiling right away Next rain it happened again So they came back out and supposedly fixed the roof again Some time later they had a gentleman come out and make the repairs to the inside and he did a great job except he didnt paint the wall and it remained that way until we moved out Called the police once for some crackhead and her boyfriend that were blowing weed smoke into her sons face The son was about 45 years old They finally evicted them They did a facelift on the apartment complex which was just polishing a turd One of the things they did was to change out all light bulbs and in doing so the new kitchen fixture was smaller than the previous one Not horrible but you could see up into the roof and it just look awful That probably has not been fixed Newest

the gentleman everything that was wrong and he said its all good and dont worry about anything The woman that did the final walkthru was shocked at how clean the apartment was and that it didnt even look like we lived there that long at this point I was under the assumption that we would receive more than 50 of our deposit back Well I was proven wrong I was just informed that I was being dinged

something to eat Two other couples and I were looking to get some food and my friend accidently bumped in two a table on his way to the bathroom We all ordered food without alcoholic beverages and the server said that management told him my friend had to leave because he was too intoxicated I understand an establishment not wanting to sere alcohol to someone intoxicated but no one ordered anything alcoholic to drink I asked to talk to the manger which took at least 20 min he then explained to me that my friend could not stay due to it being a Friday night and its way to busy to deal with this kind of inconvenience If it was a Monday or Tuesday no big deal but since it was a Friday he didnt have the time The worst part of the entire visit is it put such a sour taste in my mouth I will be

paid for the woman gave me a very half hearted apology and offered me a credit for next time They can take their credit and put it somewhere that will flavor their food better The fried rice is tasteless and the chicken is spongy The sushi rice was not sticky but rather gooey The tempura was bland and the sauce was completely flavorless They claim to offer huge discounts on their sushi but

that I have ordered The Margaritas are good Thats where it ends The salsa is BLAND It needs an element of freshness and salt The tortilla chips come out brown and dry as though they are cooked in old oil The chicken tacos that I ordered the last time I was there needed salt and flavor in general The same is true for the fish tacos The pork has a strange after taste One of the reviewers said cinnamon and that is a decent descriptionThe rice looks and tastes like mush Again no flavor It used to be much better The Mexican chicken soup is oily and lacks flavor big surprise How can Mexican food be under salted Its perplexing The peoplethe place Its decorated nicely but thats where the warm fuzzy feeling stops When we walk in there they are always too busy to even acknowledge us I never feel the owner or at least I think she is is warm and friendly Its a real turnoff Once we are seated and after the ships and salsa arrive we always have to ask for silverware Is it too much to preset

to feel really uncomfortable and immediately questioned my decision The lady really lacked experience she really didnt know what she was doing She didnt even know how to use the tweezers needed to place the extension on my existing lash They kept dropping on my face She quickly gave up using the tweezers to apply the lash and surprisingly she started applying the lashes WITH HER OWN FINGERS She was struggling tremendously dropping the lashes on my face almost every time At that point I started to really regret my decision Not to mention that she was pulling out my own eyelashes with tweezers

the lateness and it was very late when they got theirs that the two freshest seated tables then got served and then the server who frankly had the table manner of a truckstop waitress with her jokes and comments and style of talking about the place she was working apologized for the amount of rice but that they had gotten the last of it By that I assumed she meant that the serving in the pot was shy of a full serving of rice but then the manager came out about an hour into our wait so it was around 830pm and apologized for the lateness and the few minutes delay in the order printing The couple that was there before us that had not been served were also told as were we that our meal would be half priced By almost 9pm we still had only had two baskets of cracker bread and a couple of drink refills Dr Pepper and Indian Chai for my wife When food finally came out for the couple that had been seated before us they were told there is no more rice sorry but we did not expect to get

instructions and what can and cannot be moved which I had specifically asked about in several phone calls to the office 3 men completed the move 1 out of the 3 had absolutely no business being employed by a moving company dealing with furniture or heavy objects He struggled with my dresser and several times I instinctually stepped toward him because it looked like he was going to fall andor drop the dresser completely He rested the dresser on a stair while they tried to get it up the stairwell These rests caused several punctures in the back of the dresser because it was banging into the top of the landing banister each time At the end of the move I sat down with the guy who was in charge and gave him the necessary information for the damage claim After this was done another guy started to fill out the rest of the paperwork and add up the time and cost for the job This took several minutes and he did all of the calculations without a calculator and had to review the numbers several times He then told us we were being charged for an additional 15 minutes because the move was estimated for 3 hours 930am 1230pm and he did not finish the paperwork until 1232pm After the paperwork was done they returned to the truck and I walked upstairs to further inspect my dresser and saw that the boxspring that was supposed to be on the bed was in the wrong room and the other boxspring was resting against a dresser and the mattress resting against the wall I moved the boxspring into the correct room and placed the mattress on the boxspring and then noticed a block of wood part of the bed frame sitting on the floor I ran outside and luckily the truck was still there and asked them to return to finish putting together the frame First they said it had come from somewhere else and then when we pointed out that there was an identical piece on the other side they put it together to include this piece I was told I would be contacted to arrange a time for someone to look at the dresser in order to replace the back panel I did not hear from them for a week and then called and was given the number of their wood worker I called him and left a message I didnt hear back and called the main office again and told them I had left him a message and not heard back They said they would follow up I did not hear from them again and finally called the corporate office I was reassured that they would follow up with the local office and I should hear from someone shortly After several days I called back to the corporate office and she looked up my information and said that she had never heard back from the local office She also did not think to contact them again or reach out to me Maybe next month someone will actually come out to look at the dresser and by next year

master bathroom sink However the faucet was located inside a wall that was covered by a mirror mounted to the wall from the countertop to the ceiling He told me that Id have to get someone in to remove the mirror I understood and agreed At that point he gave me an invoice for the 27500 he quoted I asked if this payment would apply to the repair that needed to be done after the mirror was removed and he told me no That would only apply to work done the same day I was furious 27500 for a total of 30 minutes spent in my home and no work completed I had the mirror removed and had them back to do the repair only to have them come a second time and now inform me that the faucet component that was inside the wall should be replaced So he left and told me that he would include the bill for that day when he came back to replace the faucet after I went to a supply house and found the part needed After finding the necessary part I considered using a different company but I figured that I was in this far with Epic I may as well let them finish The same plumber came back and replaced the faucet body The work took about 45 minutes He then presented a bill for 50000 He told me that the

another 6 tapas Initially the waitress was a little pushy trying to get us to place an order and hovering nothing like feeling pressure and when I finally ordered the wine for the table she seemed slightly taken aback that I ordered the wine instead of the menfolk I worked in the biz 20yrs ago and I know wine so really who cares who orders Our cousin the other lady in the group ordered a flight of wine tasters and was waiting for the charcuterie to arrive so she could enjoy some of the cheese with her wine 45 minutes later we finally had to enquire as to where are meal was since we had a concert to go to in an hour What we were told was there was a large group in the house and only 2 in the kitchen What we heard was we didnt properly staff our restaurant for this evening and so all the customers food will take a long time Seriously a charcuterie board taking 60 minutes 10 minutes later it finally arrived It was certainly delicious but the wine flight had long been consumed by this time 5 minutes later the tapas started arriving and of course we were running late so everything was eaten hastily and we cant help but wonder prepared this way also The BC Seared Scallops were gritty although the broth was tasty The Eggplant Chips were missing the eggplant and all you could taste was the crispy coating The Falafels were doughy inside The Flight Bite with Lamb Stew was good

Even more delightful were the accompanying cooked winter greens Holy deliciousnesseveryone agreed and we chowed down on those delectable greens like hungry little rabbits During our meal we asked for the wine menu again since the cousin with the empty wine flight had not been asked if she wanted anything further to drink For a waitress who was hovering at the beginning we had to battle to get and keep her attention now Our cousin was drinking white and asking for suggestions She was given a recommendation by the waitress who then turned to leave without addressing any of the rest of us We called her backsince we also wanted to order more wine Wow does body language speak volumes and we felt like we were imposing on our waitress I ordered 2 more wine tasters for hubs myself Then the waitress turned to run away again not even addressing the white wine drinker who was also ready to order We called her back YET again and uneasily felt like we were still bothering her Since we were already late for the concert we had no time for dessert or an after dinner beverage We spent a lot of money for a mediocre evening and left slightly disappointed by the overall experience The cousins advised they enjoyed the company and some of the foodwine but this would not be there first choice again As for us I am hoping it was just bad planning and a bad night for the restaurant unfortunately

for his suggestiions of my take out lunch the last time I was in It was a hit OK thats it for the pleasantries There was a little short grumpy women who has never waited on me before My bill was 17 and I left a 3 tip on the table When I stopped at the cashier to pay my bill the little short grumpy women asked me if I had cash I said sorry I dont have anymore cash on me The little short grumpy women then rang everything and applied the balance to my debit card I still had to sign my receipt When I handed it back to her she turned the receipt toward me and asked No tip I looked at her a little confused at first but replied I left it on the table Now my blood pressure is rising and I wanted to say a few things to her for insulting me I decided Yelp would be a better way to go She also reprimanded a young man I believe hes new in their language about the number of place settings on the table I dont know his name either but he wore black framed glasses and worked the room with the younger female server You could tell by the expression on his face that he was a little embarrassed since she yeld across the room Well the little short grumpy older woman ruined my lunch I thought about her condescending remark to me all the way home Hopefully she is not the owner because she should be a bus person only This same little short grumpy older women borrowed the hot sauce from my table She didnt ask but she did say hello as a distraction while she had to reach pass me to get itWhen the little short grumpy older women retuned the hot sauce it literally was a driveby It startled me to see the hot sauce sliding across my table like a baseball player sliding into home plate She never broke her stride and never looked back Ive been eating lunchearly dinner here since 2004 and as

Wrongapparently the place still has the newness factor and I drove around 10 minutes trying to find a parking space I tried the valet parking across the street but they were full and I ended up driving around before settling on a space 3 blocks away Thankfully there were a couple of seats at the bar which I claimed one Looking around the place I felt really old here The place seems to cater to the younger crowd even at 8pm The bar was busy It was about 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged me Then I asked what their beers were and she explained them little did I know that the menu she would hand me in a few minutes would contain a list of their beers Thankfully they have a bunch of craft beers on tap The food menu is small and consists of apps think chips with salsa queso or guac salads tacos and such but your choices are limited for all of them I went with the recommendation from another review of the queso with everything except chorizo for an app and 2 tacos rojas which were all vegetarian Another disappointment when both arrived at the same time The queso was mediocre at best It was very grainy and the extras of black beans and jalapenos were on top of a cheese crust rather than mixed in the queso The tacos were decent but nothing i would consider better than average Service is what caused this to be a 2 star review rather than a 3 Although there were 3 bartenders only one seemed to be my bartender but she disappeared and I didnt see her after one Are you ok here Another bartender asked me if I wanted another beer but that was itat that point I was ready to close my bill The 3rd one asked again if I needed another beer and I stated I was done and finally I received a check Unfortunately at the time it was too late to make up for the other mistakes So if you like trendy places in trendy neighborhoods with limited parking perhaps you would enjoy this one But honestly my other choice when i chose to stop here was Moes down the street After spending some time at Bakersfield I wish I would have chose Moes This place seems to be popular with some of the locals but if you check their website it appears they are yet another chain with their other locations in the midwest In order to survive here they need to be open to people over 40 improve their bar service and make their restaurant a destination where people will walk for blocks

locations the one in Denver is where it all started and is a legend unto itself If you visit the Denver website you can view videos about the house and you will see repeatedly that USA Today included 13th Floor in their list of Top 13 Haunted Houses in America The Arizona incarnation leaves something to be desired Located in a rentedout strip mall in a seedy part of Bell Avenue 13th Floor does not impress you from the getgo What you do notice right away is the crowd of hundreds of people lined up to get inside and get spooked I took this as a good sign even though we showed up half an hour after they opened Buy your tickets online if you can There is a line of hundreds to get in the house and a similar line for tickets as well If youre a patient person and you want some time to build up the anticipation and adrenaline by being surrounded by a ton of giddy and jumpy people go for the lines They have actors with chainsaws and creepy makeup pacing around scaring the easy targets posing for pictures and giving you a preview of whats to come The actual haunted house is nothing special If youve been to one before youll see it all again You have actors in creepy makeup and clothing jumping out at you slamming things against the wall or floor and getting up in your face There are rooms youre led through themed as grisly defiled homes kitchens and hallways there was a piratethemed area and a misty jungle to walk through I was disappointed in the lack of jumps in that area the scare potential among the closepressing fog bushes and trees was great I wish I had been able to go through more slowly to admire the props and background setup everything was something youve seen before but it was beautifully set up 13th Floor may not have scared me but they get points for attention to detail One thing that Ill admit Ive never seen before was the usage of partially closed garage doors placed in strategic areas Open only a foot or two from the floor an actor would get a running start and slide on his knees out from under the door and then pop up next to you The first time or two I saw this it was downright hilarious this does not seem to be an easy or very practiced thing for the actors to do and some of them ate it or slammed into my legs like they were trying to take me out The actors are not supposed toallowed to touch you I will admit that Im not an easy person to scare Im not jumpy or unnerved by the dark loud sounds or people lunging at my face suddenly When you take care of a toddler all day you develop a sort of Clint Eastwood hardness and eventually lose your flinching reflex There were however people all around me screaming their heads off in terror One girl was even sobbing If that isnt a testament to 13th Floors fear factor I dont know what is The fatal flaw of my visit was the fact that the event staff was not separating the groups for long enough time periods Things cease to be scary when youre basically part of a continuous shuffling line of people Youre rushed and you can see ahead of you whats about to pop out of that dark corner because you just watched the group ahead of you deal with it Our total time going through the house was 13 minutes Yes I timed it We paid 35 per person to get a VIP ticket which gives you access to a much shorter line regular admission is 25 Had I paid half that amount I would have written this off as an unusual fun activity to try out on a Saturday night However losing nearly forty bucks on this snooze stings If our group of 4 was alone hearing only the distant screams of other people

what the inspection report meant I received an email back from Steve the owner I presume and he essentially said your AC unit is causing your tenants monthly power bill to increase The cost of replacing it would be less than the cost of repairing it You need a new AC I replied and asked how much more the bill is than it should be and how is it even possible to measure that I also asked why if I need a new AC was I not informed of this back in March after the inspection No response I sent another email asking about the status of my questions No response I know it is their busy season it

wanted to try we talked about it for weeks Keep in mind that I write these reviews not just to help the customers be wise consumers but also so that business owners can get feedback from customers and gain insight into running their business in the most successful manner With that said I struggle with this review The company has really been well marketed and over hyped The truck is beautiful and as up to date as possible The line was extremely long and it took quite a while for food to come out While waiting in line I noticed that several people were complaining and returning food I was honestly pretty worried at that point and tried to hear why they were coming back The complaints were all the same The lobster rolls they had ordered were supposed to be hot and that the lobster was cold I asked one lady what was wrong with her food and she told me that it was ice cold in the middle People were not complaining about the line to order They were complaining about the wait for their food There was a huge group of people waiting for food Suddenly a woman appeared frantically trying to get into the trucks front door which was locked She had Walmart bags in her arms I said to my wife that she must have made a Walmart run for Lobster We were in the parking lot for Sams Club and next to the Walmart I was joking but I think she went to get bread Thats right my roll was on bread I would say it was Texas Toast to be exact So it was my turn to order The guy is taking orders from the window which is quite high and I had trouble hearing him He used a tablet to have me sign for my debit card They ask for an optional tip which I find absurd when no one is doing anything worth tipping They didnt bring my food and as a matter of fact I had to ask for a napkin and a fork When I went back to get a knife the lady was very nice but I still wouldnt say it was worthy of even more money I must admit that I was taken back by the price I know that lobster can be expensive but this is extremely expensive for the size of roll you get It is about double what I think it is worth Our order did not take too long to get about 8 minutes I guess once the cook came back it was easier to pump out food By the way I watched to see if she washed her hands and she did The man called our name over the loud speaker that is useless I didnt see anyone else go to the window so I figured it must be mine Anyway we got our food and I was shocked at how small it was My wife and I always split food I could eat three of these on my own We each took our two bites and the Lobster is wonderful It has a wonderful sweet flavor There was a small line of mayo on the Texas toast that did not make much difference I would double the mayo but that is me It was lobster on bread Well the wait was over and in two bites the meal was over I looked at my wife and laughed I said well that was a big bubble buster She said she thought the flavor was great but that the 20 we spent was not worth it For the record the roll was 1650 plus tax and tip I felt a little robbed to be honest I am the type of person that tips huge amounts for great service and doesnt mind paying a lot of money for quality food and service In this case it was a bit much Lets not forget this is a food truck They dont even have the overhead of a brick and mortar restaurant They must be making a killing off the name and

server came by about 5 minutes later We had to very quickly decide what our entire order would consist of including all sushirolls etc This turned out fine but I didnt appreciate having to order everything up front Our server was polite but it quickly became quite obvious that the restaurant staff were closing the restaurant down to the degree that 15 minutes after having our food our server was coming to get our soy sauce bottle out of the way to which I objected as we were obviously still in the middle of dinner He then dropped the bill off a very short time later Having felt rushed

slow down Despite having three servers working five tables it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and a small complimentary basket of chips Did I mention that the basket of chip was small Our

was far too watery making it difficult to get the right balance of salsa and chip I also enjoyed the Quesadillas de Rajas y Queso we ordered as an appetizer The corn masa coating was cooked to perfection but I would have preferred a Mexican cheese over the mozzarella used as the filling The roasted poblanos were excellent and a small serving of crema was a welcome addition to the dish After a long wait about 20 minutes and only one refill of our basket of chips we received the entrees I ordered one of the specials a beef barbacoa based on the recommendation of the server The beef was tender but a little under seasoned The dish was overpowered by a pile of raw onions that topped the beef I like onions but these gave the dish a sulphery aftertaste The sides also were disappointing the refried beans were overcooked and lacked texture the Mexican rice was mushy and bland With the little more focus on the details this could have been a great meal The kids ordered cheese enchiladas and chicken enchiladas The salsa verde lacked punch The tomatillos really needed to be roasted longer to give the green sauce more depth The chicken was well cooked but under seasoned and I was

it very chilly Im happy I had my coat to wear during lunch The beers were very cool a bit expensive but thats expected The descriptions of the beers were on point I think we tried all but 1 because they didnt have it available I could easily crave some of these beers The food was lacking I think the owners need to focus more on getting the customers substance in their food For example we ordered the cheese platter 14 The platter came with 3 small pieces of toasted bread scattered walnut bits that no one know what to do with a few jumbo olives and some standard cheeses We asked for more toasted bread and about 10 minutes later we got 4 more pieces There were 5 of us An appetizer that is over 9 should be able to feed more than 3 people They were also out of anything pretzel which was a letdown understandable since this is still a new business My pizza was pretty amazing though All of the pizzas sounded delicious the ingredients were very fresh Something that was off was that each additional topping was 2 Its just not worth it here Its really not The rest of the table ordered sandwiches Synopsis nothing to write home about The chips they give you on the side seemed like they were from a bag The ones my boyfriend got seemed like they came from the bottom of the bag When everyone was done eating we all said we could definitely eat more This also goes back to the substance point I made Im not sure if this place wants the customers to leave more room for the beer or not If thats the case then they need to lower the food prices This place needs some time to figure out how

water glasses though she did check in to see that our food had arrived okay The fish tacos were disappointing to say the least The fish itself had been fried in a crispy but flavorless batter The

and brought it back and put it in myself However I had someone else to check battery and they said all it needed was a slow charge The mechanic said that my starter was fried which the manager agreed was not very professional words used by the mechanic I didnt believe anything was wrong with my starter So I told them to just put the fuel pump fuel filter and vacuum line on and we will see if it will start up afterwards For these 3 parts and labor they gave a price of over 1204 My investigation I called up a neighbor Firestone in Fort Mill and the woman gave a me price of 58487 for the fuel pump fuel filter and labor Why is the price so far apart in difference I questioned the manager about the call I made to Fort Mill Firestone and told him the woman gave me a price of 58487 He said cant be I repeated myself and said I just called them and thats the price she gave me Again he says cant be while shaking his head I felt like he just called me a liar I also called up some other

wasnt all that I anticipated to be especially for 6oz and 180 First off the steak was served in 2 pieces 1 piece was 3 oz and supposedly a section of the ribeye and the other 3 oz piece was the fat cap I was skeptical about the fact that a chef would serve such a delicate piece of meat decomposed into 2 parts especially one of that quality in this case it was supposedly grade A5 Nevertheless I went with the flow In my opinion 1 of the 2 pieces of beef was not Wagyu ribeye but rather some other cut of beef The fat ratio was not present and the 3oz ribeye was not tender The fat cap piece was indeed Wagyu quality which I thoroughly enjoyed but the ribeye portion was not I was disappointed but I didnt let that ruin my experience The service was fantastic the best I ever had Both waiters were attentive and very knowledgeable The reason why I am giving this 2 stars regardless of the poor food quality is the following as my friend and I reviewed our 528 bill for the evening I noticed a random 2 charge listed as a Sauce I did ask the server to bring me a side of the House sauce but didnt expect he would charge me for it Not a big deal I can afford 2 its the principle that counts When I asked him about it and told him that I think it was kind of ridiculous that I am being charged an extra 2 for the house steak sauce the comment was thats absolutely right 2 for the sauce With that

looking to buy a Wrangler JL or Cherokee they have a large inventory to choose from however I went in looking for a Renegade Trailhawk of which they had ONE in the whole store Luckily I came to see just that one I had already looked at it online I show up begin to head inside and am met by a salesperson Sean from Michigan who promptly runs to meet me before I enter the showroom Immediately I inform him of which vehicle I came to look at and he quickly obliges by bringing a golf cart to the front for us to drive to the vehicle We get to the Trailhawk and the sticker price is priced about 2k higher than online I inform Sean of this and he takes a minute to look at the website confirms what I said and lets me know that they would honor the online price The sticker price contradicting the online price was a little off putting What if I hadnt checked online first So we get in the Jeep Sean drives it to the gas station to fill up and lets me know that I am fine to go ahead and get into the drivers seat I move over to the drivers seat Meanwhile he is paying for the gas and as Im sitting there Im looking around checking everything out The first noticeable mishap was a scratch on the interior door I mention it to him and he brushes it off as just residue that will wash off Umm no it was clearly NOT just residue nevermind that I already saw him scratch the tint with the seatbelt buckle As Im looking around more I cant help but think that this 2018 vehicle with 4 miles on it literally looks like it has been used It was dirty and there was trash in the door I guess from a previous test drive It just wasnt presentable at all Sean made sure to mention that it had been on the lot for about a month and that usually cars dont stay on the lot that long Okay sooo why is THIS one still there Then comes the nitty gritty part of car buying the money and the numbers BEFORE I even indicate whether or not I actually want to proceed with the purchase Sean insists that I hurry and fill out the credit application I promptly put things on hold informing him that we needed to talk a liiiittle bit more about the exact details before we go any further After honoring the online price and offering 5k for my trade in I let him know that the offer on the trade in just wont work at all Good thing I did ample research before coming in because I was well aware that EVEN as a trade in my vehicle was worth at least 7k So after a bit of back and forth and him leaving to ask the manager we settle on 6500 Next was time to talk about financing and down payment Luckily they didnt really give me any hassle on wanting to go through my own third party broker for financing but once we started talking about down payment the conversation took a pretty crazy turn I insisted that I wanted to put a down payment to lower the financed amount I let Sean know that I wanted to pay in cash not check of which I would have to go and get He informs me that he doesnt think they can take cash as a down payment So funny because the dealership I ended up buying from let me pay using my debit card same as cash So we went from first putting a down payment to we dont take cash can you write a check to how about you dont put a down payment AT ALL to okay we CAN take cash to why do you have to go and GET the cash cant your boyfriend just bring it to you At this point I realize that this is all going way wrong For one I am in not so many words somewhat being held hostage they have the keys to my trade in of which I had to ask for when I began heading towards the exit Im asked not to leave to get my down payment THEN Sean begins grasping at straws to get me to proceed with filling out the credit app I oblige just to get him to stop hassling me Deciding that Im really not into this particular Trailhawk I ask if theres any way they can keep an eye out on a white one for me instead Sean tells me they CANT keep an eye out for a white one and continues trying everything in his power to get me not to leave even after we discussed that I wanted to go get cash I finally am allowed to leave but only if I promise to be back in 45 minutes nevermind the place I need to go is across town It was about 5pm and he wanted an exact time of how long it would take for me to get the money It was very awkward He informs me that while Im gone theyll go ahead and run my app and I beg them to hold off until I get back Obviously at this point Im NOT coming back Had Sean not been so pushy and not forthcoming regarding the fact that they COULD have looked out for a white Trailhawk for me he later back peddled over text and told me they could make it happen I may have proceeded with my purchase here But I ended up going to a competitor which turned out to be the better deal for me",

horses but that wasnt a problem at all Sitting in the front made great seats be we were the last to be fed pretty much Id recommend sitting closer to the center and avoid the ends of the arena unless you really want to cheer for a certain country in that area Over all the show was pretty cool I didnt understand when booking dragon doesnt do any of the competing in the games and is more of the antagonist That means youre sitting in the bulk of the show with no one to cheer on even in the start As an adult that is ok I took a while to figure out we didnt have a king at all Im not sure how ideal that section is for the kids You do get to cheer for the villain that has pyrotechnics whos pretty awesome a bit later on though so maybe that has extra draw to the kids I like the show Its light hearted and fun with some extra pizzazz Its interactive and you can be a bit silly Its not my favorite show but its pretty good Likely the best family show Ive seen in Vegas My food sucked though the soup was ok as was the dessert but the vegetarian ravioli was gross VERY over cooked soggy and bland I didnt finish my small serving because I almost threw up in my mouth due to texture

disappeared The section was served faster than many of the others to at least he had a system For mom and dad there are some cute kings and saucy wenches that like to dance and sing The horses are gorgeous and the games are fun to watch Im sure much of that is theatrical tricks due to just how dangerous some of those actions they were taking really were back in the day but I couldnt figure it

but mixed nonetheless We ordered a couple of the specialty drinks the Wiskey Smash and the House on the Rock They were both really good and worth returning for We opted for a couple of appetizers mostly because the rest of the menu felt a bit uninspiring given the price points The Frites were fine if perhaps under seasoned They came with catsup and a pepper aioli The aioli seemed over worked it had more of a butter texture It did have decent flavor but lacked the expected mouth feel of an aioli We also ordered the Shrimp Scallops and Grits This dish was worth recommending and ordering again The shrimp were probably unnecessary they were smallish and underwhelming compared to the perfectly cooked scallops and medley of roastedsaut\u00e9ed veggies We took a look at the dessert menu and given a redo Id order something else We ordered the bread pudding It was more of two small pieces of French Toast Decent flavor but didnt pass muster for a Bread Pudding It was served with a handful of walnuts and some sort of sorbet The walnuts could have used some sort of culinary treatment The sorbet had a descent flavor perhaps ginger but textually didnt work well with the mislabeled bread pudding I would have expected something with a creamy mouth feel Olivers is still pretty new its listed as hot and new but it seems a bit sterile and as others have noted its noisy The drinks take Olivers from a two star to a three star place Its nice to see another restaurant in this area of town I think Olivers still needs to find it groove if it wants to be a long term resident in the

basic On top of that one of the waitress has started putting things away as people were still trickling in The kids menu was very basic and I thought Id just complement their breakfast by adding yoghurt and fruit from the buffet As a parent I wanted them to have a more balanced breakfast No big deal Ill eat less and they can have my share Its a buffet Thats when one of the waitress snapped at me saying that she should charge me for the banana and the yoghurt since those items are only for adults who pay for the buffet She went off for a good 5 minutes and I was just amazed at how she would worry about charging a customer for a 25 cent banana and a 50 cent yoghurt when the customer just spent more than 300 in her establishment I was going to take her name down but suddenly everyone went into hiding in the kitchen So I had to bring this to the managers attention I believe his name was BJ He did a great job taking care of the issue Zach at the front desk was also great So thumbs up for

our waitress whom is super amazing and has a lot of good reccomendation The food portion is super small more like tapa even though they priced at entree price We ended up ordering a lot Food is good

of the bedrooms There was what appeared to be knife marks in walls They made this right by giving us an upgraded apartment We got moved in all seemed to be ok Well the first rain came and that all changedSee the posted photos The ceiling leaked causing what we called our ceiling zit They fixed the roof but not the ceiling right away Next rain it happened again So they came back out and supposedly fixed the roof again Some time later they had a gentleman come out and make the repairs to the inside and he did a great job except he didnt paint the wall and it remained that way until we moved out Called the police once for some crackhead and her boyfriend that were blowing weed smoke into her sons face The son was about 45 years old They finally evicted them They did a facelift on the apartment complex which was just polishing a turd One of the things they did was to change out all light bulbs and in doing so the new kitchen fixture was smaller than the previous one Not horrible but you could see up into the roof and it just look awful That probably has not been fixed Newest Management not sure of the name These folks seemed to be ok We asked for an extension and it was granted and I am thankful for that This is where it all goes south We have two cats We paid the pet deposit We paid the monthly pet rent Upon move out we cleaned we mopped and we had carpets cleaned I was asked by maintenance days before move out if there was anything wrong with the apartment I told the gentleman everything that was wrong and he said its all good and dont worry about anything The woman that did the final walkthru was shocked at how clean the apartment was and that it didnt even look like we lived there that long at this point I was under the assumption that we

at the time we were the third couple seated on the patio three more tables were seated during the time that we ate some cracker bread with a very nice mint sauce We started at 730pm roughly We then noticed that after the first of the three earliest tables was served apologetically for the lateness and it was very late when they got theirs that the two freshest seated tables then got served and then the server who frankly had the table manner of a truckstop waitress with her jokes and comments and style of talking about the place she was working apologized for the amount of rice but that they had gotten the last of it By that I assumed she meant that the serving in the pot was shy of a full serving of rice but then the manager came out about an hour into our wait so it was around 830pm and apologized for the lateness and the few minutes delay in the order printing The couple that was there before us that had not been served were also told as were we that our meal would be half priced By almost 9pm we still had only had two baskets of cracker bread and a couple of drink refills Dr Pepper and Indian Chai for my wife When food finally came out for the couple that had been seated before us they were told there is no more rice sorry but we did not expect to get slammed like this Meanwhile of course both my wife and I realized that our dishes would also be best served

through the window there were several tables that had been seated after us inside that were already eating so while several of us had a horrible experience that night it is no doubt also true that many people had a flawless night at the same restaurant I guess timing is everything and I really am not sure if I ever want to give them a second shot but might try calling the manager this morning

repair done I agreed I also thought they must use this practice to ensure that they didnt spend alot of time in discovering a leak only to be told that a customer didnt want the repair done After 10 minutes he discovered the leak was coming from a faucet in the master bathroom sink However the faucet was located inside a wall that was covered by a mirror mounted to the wall from the countertop to the ceiling He told me that Id have to get someone in to remove the mirror I understood and agreed At that point he gave me an invoice for the 27500 he quoted I asked if this payment would apply to the repair that needed to be done after the mirror was removed and he told me no That would only apply to work done the same day I was furious 27500 for a total of 30 minutes spent in my home and no work completed I had the mirror removed and had them back to do the repair only to have them come a second time and now inform me that the faucet component that was inside the wall should be replaced So he left and told me that he would include the bill for that day when he came back to replace the faucet after I went to a supply house and found the part needed After finding the necessary part I considered using a different company but I figured that I was in this far with Epic I may as well let them finish The same plumber came back and replaced the faucet body The work took about 45 minutes

from renting from this company or hiring them for their rental management services then this review is worth my time Considering one of the 3 five star reviews on Google is literally from this

the Managers comment about it being hard to please everyone yes very much so However I believe I speak for everyone in this review thread when I say the customer service is unfathomably awful These problems are not matters of people pleasing but tenants respectfully requesting to have working appliances within a reasonable time frame and decent customer service if anything at all and this company is light years away from that I simply cannot associate bad customer service with protecting the clients investment or putting the clients first Aside from the tasteless comments that were given from their staff our service requests were closed out ignored and other services requests were looked at by their repair man who did essentially nothing to fix the problem At the beginning of our lease we went months without a working washer When we decided to request a deduction on rent for the time gone without a working washer from our property manager Kim she bantered back and forth with me saying we did not have a right to a reduction on our rent referencing that we could easily take our laundry to a laundromat Our leaking air conditioner also went about 2 months without being fixed and my cousin slipped and fell injuring his back Eventually after speaking with the head manager Mike Gross and threatening to gain legal counsel we received a slight deduction in rent for the month Regardless it was a situation that was handled poorly from the very start It is outrageous to think that even after my cousin injured his back because of a service request going ignored our property manager not only regretted to give us a simple apology but instead became rude and disrespectful If thats not terrible customer service I dont know what is Fortunately we will no longer be continuing our lease with this company I informed the landlord that although we love her unit and although she is a wonderful person we will not accept dealing with an awful company like Property

us from retrieving proof of past work orders and problems My cousin and I are reasonable people and have had our fair share of jobs working in customer service fields It is my hope that this company

its needed and Im sure we were the first to book because we could have sat anywhere We choose front row in the middle of Dragon I was worried about eating so close to horses but that wasnt a problem at all Sitting in the front made great seats be we were the last to be fed pretty much Id recommend sitting closer to the center and avoid the ends of the arena unless you really want to cheer for a certain country in that area Over all the show was pretty cool I didnt understand when booking dragon doesnt do any of the competing in the games and is more of the antagonist That means youre sitting in the bulk of the show with no one to cheer on even in the start As an adult that is ok I took a while to figure out we didnt have a king at all Im not sure how ideal that section is for the kids You do get to cheer for the villain that has pyrotechnics whos pretty awesome a bit later on though so maybe that has extra draw to the kids I like the show Its light hearted and fun with some extra pizzazz Its interactive and you can be a bit silly Its not my favorite show but its pretty good Likely the best family show Ive seen in Vegas My food sucked though the soup was ok as was the dessert but the vegetarian ravioli was gross VERY over cooked soggy and bland I didnt finish my small serving because I almost threw up in my mouth due to texture issues They serve you pop thats been sitting in pitchers for I dont know how long so its completely flat by the time it gets poured into your glass For that reason I wish I had ordered from the expensive bar over drinking flat soda waiting for the water that was never to arrive My fiance barely got through his hen saying it was just ok Dessert was alright and helped alleviate the left over ravioli in my mouth that was driving me crazy

of the others to at least he had a system For mom and dad there are some cute kings and saucy wenches that like to dance and sing The horses are gorgeous and the games are fun to watch Im sure much of that is theatrical tricks due to just how dangerous some of those actions they were taking really were back in the day but I couldnt figure it out myself If there is an option to skip food id do that

flavorful meh not so much I tried the chocolate carrot lemon and caramel So here is the breakdown on the little cakes 1 The chocolate is duh chocolate cake with a chocolateraspberry mouse filling and topped with ganache The cake was dark like chocolate but pretty dull in flavor The filling was there but not discernable enough to stand out as a flavor unto itself And the ganache was more like dry chocolaty icing IMO not really worth the calories 2 The caramel is a butter cake think yellow filled with caramel mouse and topped with a light caramel frosting The cake was a pretty standard yellow cake The filling was again so mild in flavor that there really wasnt much point in its being there The frosting described as mildly flavored was more of an understatement I really think it was white frosting with a light glazing of caramel underneath IMO really not worth the calories or the price 3The carrot is filled with cream cheese mouse and topped with cream cheese frosting At least this one resembled its description but I wasnt blown away 4 The lemon is a lemon cake filled with lemon chiffon and topped with lemon frosting This was the closest thing to decent in the half dozen that I took home I couldnt detect any lemon in the cake but the filling almost had a hint of tartness and the frosting actually had some zest mixed in which is what I would expect I will definitely support Sweet

recommending and ordering again The shrimp were probably unnecessary they were smallish and underwhelming compared to the perfectly cooked scallops and medley of roastedsaut\u00e9ed veggies We took a look at the dessert menu and given a redo Id order something else We ordered the bread pudding It was more of two small pieces of French Toast Decent flavor but didnt pass muster for a Bread Pudding It was served with a handful of walnuts and some sort of sorbet The walnuts could have used some sort of culinary treatment The sorbet had a descent flavor perhaps ginger but textually didnt work well with the mislabeled bread pudding I would have expected something with a creamy mouth feel Olivers is still pretty new its listed as hot and new but it seems a bit sterile and as others have noted its

decided to try their restaurant which offered a 10 breakfast buffet It was a really expensive deal as the buffet was very basic On top of that one of the waitress has started putting things away as people were still trickling in The kids menu was very basic and I thought Id just complement their breakfast by adding yoghurt and fruit from the buffet As a parent I wanted them to have a more balanced breakfast No big deal Ill eat less and they can have my share Its a buffet Thats when one of the waitress snapped at me saying that she should charge me for the banana and the yoghurt since those items are only for adults who pay for the buffet She went off for a good 5 minutes and I was just amazed at how she would worry about charging a customer for a 25 cent banana and a 50 cent yoghurt when the customer just spent more than 300 in her establishment I was going to take her name down but suddenly everyone went into hiding in the kitchen So I had to bring this to the managers attention I believe his name was BJ He did a great job taking care of the issue Zach at the front desk was also great So thumbs up for the remodeling and customer service at the hotel The restaurant

The food was mostly natural andor organic which is preferred They also had fresh pastries to pick from which my little one enjoyed The place was kid friendly and the food was tasty It is a little hard to find if you are not familiar with the area and its kind of in an unexpected place The fact that it is in the same complex as a fitness center is very smart with the rejuvenated health kick in todays society", "predicted": 4, "actual": 2}, {"input": "Visted here 725148114initally we were in a 2 bedroom suitewhich was nicetvs in each roomlarge balconycoffee in main office every morningI dont really have any complaints staff was friendly when interactedwouldve been nice to have waiters by the pool taking orders for drinksmaybe a restaurant on the property as well couldve been a nice touchwhen we upgraded to the 3 bedroom I was disappointed only the master had a tvthey left cute little notes saying they clean under the bedsbut they definitely dont clean under the couchwhich I found something that resembled a pork grindhousekeeping can do a better job at thorough cleaningespecially since there were ants in the kitchen upon moving inother than thatit was a nice stay", "predicted": 4, "actual": 2}, {"input": "25 Came here for Macaron Day and ended up buying half a dozen more besides the free one I got It wasnt until we went elsewhere that we realized that was a bit of a mistake Dont get me wrong they tasted good But they were small expensive 235 each and not as good as many other bakeries Ive tried Maybe Im spoiled from living right by Patisserie 27 but I definitely wished Id picked up more at places besides here The store was nice the staff friendly and the cake samples looked pretty cool I imagine actual cakes are their specialty so I wouldnt judge them too harshly on this experience", "predicted": 4, "actual": 2}, {"input": "Probably a 35 I like the short line for Pearl members Buffet itself is small and limited the choices are ok but not great Prime rib was delicious but fairly common at buffets Nothing special here really Spend a few more dollars and go next door to Wicked Spoon at Cosmo instead", "predicted": 1, "actual": 2}, {"input": "Any place with breakfast tacos on the menu automatically garners my immediate attention Growing up in Texas bfast tacos are a diet staple but outside those state lines you can only find breakfast burritos which are totally NOT the same thing At all Plate here includes two massive tacos on doublelayer corn with options to add sausage chorizo or bacon to your eggs cheese is included and condiments of sour cream and salsa are provided You also get a potato side reds or browns Huge portion tortillas were overflowing removed over half the filling before I could even pick up the tacos to eat properly not a complaint and the corn tortillas held up so well that I was able to stick to a single layer and used the extras to make additional tacos with the overflow Not following You can easily make 4 good sized tacos with this plate Chicken fajita omelet is a good pick too potato side and bread side included toast english muffin or biscuit Servers have no problem with substitutions and easily changed out my bell peppers for extra mushrooms Sadly the mushrooms seemed canned but there as a more than generous portion of veggies in the dish Hashbrowns were undercooked but we didnt come close to finishing Now for my gripe Youre the BISCUIT Caf\u00e9 not the breakfast taco caf\u00e9 not the omelet cafe The biscuits here were lackluster and dismal with little taste and an oddly crunchy exterior Fluffy interior was great and the raspberry jam we received was off the charts but when we ordered a side of gravy well that was bad too Virtually tasteless and gluey like a poorly made box mix I didnt expect the breakfast tacos to knock it out of the park like they did highly recommend the bacon and chorizo but to fail at making your namesake dish Really bummed by that Service was amazing and even at 1030AM on a weekend there were a few tables available without a wait But the line was out the door by noon", "predicted": 1, "actual": 2}, {"input": "Need 24hour pho Have 24 hr

never fails I always come out with bags full Great prices good items and LOTS to choose from The downside are the fruits and veggies they dont look fresh", "predicted": 1, "actual": 2}, {"input": "The sandwiches are fantastic unfortunately the atmosphere isnt something to strive for but thats not the point Its a city classic hole in the wall Its a standard every time I go to Pittsburgh", "predicted": 1, "actual": 2}, {"input": "a recent weekend dinner found the place almost empty at 7pm maybe 4 tables we were seated promptly nice high ceilinged room after we had perused the menu for awhile made our choices our waitress THEN proceeded to tell us what the kitchen was out of and what the specials were we ordered wine which upon tasting was so full of sediment it was undrinkable while she looked on blankly we suggested a decanter she brought one back and whisked away the first glass the wine once the sediment was gone was good there were bread plates on the table but we had to ask for bread the food was different and tasty while my tofu could have had more flavor the dish accompaniments made up for it", "predicted": 1, "actual": 2}, {"input": "Im not from the area but this is obviously a local chain Nice little sit downdrive thru coffee shop Good location and staff was friendly and the place was clean Coffee itself was sub par at best We tried two different drinks a latte with a little vanilla and an americano Not sure if the baristas skill was lacking or if the espresso beans they were using was the issue but both drinks did not meet our expectations To me this shop is more like a Big Chain coffee shop Not geared to highlighting the espresso itself but geared to producing overly sweet drinks that mask the taste of the coffee Just not what Im looking for in a specialty coffee shop", "predicted": 4, "actual": 2}, {"input": "Pojangmacha Restaurant should be renamed to Pojangmacha Bar The strawberry grape and lemon soju are amazing I think I have found my new favourite drink It is sweet and reminds me of koolaid Yep this is the stuff that hits you all of a sudden Plus it gets served in a little tea pot and you pour it into little shot glasses Variety sip or shoot We tried both Both work As for food the deep fried sweet and spicy chicken was great The little snacks of peanuts dressed lettuce mandarin oranges and french fries this was surprising provide absorption of the alcohol The decor was odd It was like a cottage up north or perhaps fashioned to be the original Montanas chain All in all I will return for the flavoured soju and the chicken", "predicted": 1, "actual": 2}]
